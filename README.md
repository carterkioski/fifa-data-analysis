Visualizing EPL players stats from 2020/2021 season as well as comparing it the stats for plays from FIFA 2021


The goal of this analysis is to derive insights on soccer players with a focus on the comparisons between Premier League players' actual season stats to their FIFA 2021 ratings.  

To start, I will be cleaning up some raw FIFA 21 data found on Kaggle so that I can work with it.  This data will be narrowed down to just players in the Premier League for comparisons with the actual premier league player stats and the corresponding visualization.
